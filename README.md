# PCE-3D-Agent
This is Zihan Zhou's FYP code repository. I will soon upload the code once I have removed sensitive information (such as the OpenAI key) from the original repository. If you want immediate access to my original repository, please visit https://github.com/zzh8241102/outdoor-3d-vlm. You can email me at sc20zz2@leeds.ac.uk, and I will grant access if you are relevant personnel.
